# Karya Analytics Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the Karya Analytics platform. It provides a high-level overview of planned features and enhancements across three main areas: Event Collection & ETL, Event Streaming & Processing, and Analytics.

## 1. Event Collector & ETL

### a. REST API Event Listening
- [ ] Implement a RESTful API endpoint for receiving events
- [ ] Support for both synchronous and asynchronous event processing
- [ ] Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- [ ] Rate limiting and throttling capabilities
- [ ] Comprehensive API documentation

### b. Event Governance Layer
- [ ] Enable Business Analytics teams to define event schemas and data types
- [ ] Implement validation rules for incoming events
- [ ] Provide a user-friendly interface for managing event definitions
- [ ] Logging system for discarded events that fail validation
- [ ] Versioning support for event definitions

### c. Lifecycle Management for Trait-based Constructs
- [ ] Implement parameter management at different levels:
  - [ ] Application level
  - [ ] Web session level
  - [ ] User level
  - [ ] Page level
  - [ ] Or, any custom lifecycle introduction
- [ ] Automatic parameter stitching based on context
- [ ] Inheritance and override mechanisms for parameters
- [ ] Conflict resolution strategies

### d. Multi-source Support
- [ ] Implement adapters for various event sources
- [ ] Ensure isolation of governance and lifecycle layers for each source
- [ ] Provide source-specific configuration options
- [ ] Enable monitoring and metrics for each source
- [ ] Support for source prioritization

### e. Event Transformation
- [ ] JavaScript-based transformation engine for raw events
- [ ] Pre-processing capabilities before events reach the governance layer
- [ ] Transformation templates and reusable components
- [ ] Debugging tools for transformations
- [ ] Performance optimization for transformation operations

## 2. Event Streaming and Processing

### a. Kafka Integration
- [ ] Stream all events from the Event Collector to Kafka
- [ ] Include source identifiers with each event
- [ ] Implement partitioning strategies for efficient processing
- [ ] Ensure fault tolerance and high availability
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting for the Kafka pipeline

### b. Event Processor Implementation
- [ ] Develop processor based on Apache Flink or microservice architecture
- [ ] Support for multiple destination integrations:
  - [ ] Google Ads
  - [ ] Google Analytics
  - [ ] Meta Ads
  - [ ] Data warehouses (BigQuery, Databricks, etc.)
  - [ ] Or, any custom integration
- [ ] Scalable architecture to handle high event volumes
- [ ] Monitoring and observability features

### c. Destination Management
- [ ] Plug-and-play integration system for destinations
- [ ] Business Analytics filtering capabilities for event routing
- [ ] JavaScript-based transformers for destination-specific data enrichment
- [ ] Configuration UI for managing destinations
- [ ] Testing and simulation tools for destination integrations

## 3. Analytics Platform

### a. Custom Analytics Platform
- [ ] Develop a proprietary analytics platform using collected data
- [ ] Provide insights on user behavior and product usage
- [ ] Implement dashboards and visualization tools
- [ ] Support for custom reports and metrics
- [ ] Export capabilities for further analysis

### b. Future Enhancements (Tentative)
- [ ] Machine learning capabilities for predictive analytics
- [ ] A/B testing framework
- [ ] Cohort analysis tools
- [ ] Funnel visualization and analysis
- [ ] Real-time analytics dashboards
